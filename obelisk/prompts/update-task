**IF user provided update:**
```
/update-task Add camera support alongside gallery picker
```
- Extract update_description = "Add camera support alongside gallery picker"
- Proceed to Task Update

**IF no description:**
```
/update-task
```
- Output: "What changes should be made to the task?"
- Wait for response
- Set update_description = [response]
- Proceed to Task Update

## Task Update

### 1. Load Current Task

Read `/obelisk/temp-state/task.md`

If NOT exist → Output: "No task to update. Use /new-task first."

### 2. Apply Changes to Task

**Integrate update_description into current task:**

- If update adds to scope → Add to included items
- If update removes from scope → Move to excluded or remove
- If update changes goal → Modify goal statement
- If update adds constraints → Add to constraints
- If update changes success criteria → Update criteria

**Create clear, updated task description** that incorporates changes naturally.

**Do NOT ask questions. Just apply the changes logically.**

### 3. Delete Current Task

Delete `/obelisk/temp-state/task.md`

### 4. Run Discovery with Updated Task

Execute: `/new-task [updated task description from step 2]`
